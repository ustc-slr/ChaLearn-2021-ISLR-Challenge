# 2D Top-down Human Body Pose Estimation

Multi-person human pose estimation is defined as the task of detecting the poses (or keypoints) of all people from an input image.
Top-down methods divide the task into two stages: human detection and pose estimation.
They perform human detection first, followed by single-person pose estimation given human bounding boxes.
